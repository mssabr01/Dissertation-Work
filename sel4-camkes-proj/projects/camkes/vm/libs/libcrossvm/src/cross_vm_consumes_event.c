/* CAmkES-side handler for events emitted from a CAmkES component to a
 * guest user process.
 *
 * In order for a CAmkES component to emit events to a guest user process,
 * it must have an "emits" event interfaces connected to the vmm component.
 * When the vmm receives an event, it places some information identifying
 * the event in memory visible to the guest, then injects an interrupt into
 * the guest. The guest is expected to acknowledge the interrupt by making
 * a hypercall after it's finished reading from the shared state.
