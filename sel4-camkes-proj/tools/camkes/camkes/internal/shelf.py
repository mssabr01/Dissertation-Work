'''
A limited reimplementation of Python's shelve module.

To give a bit of the back story as to why this exists, when you're really
hammering a Python shelve it has a tendency to corrupt the underlying database.
I haven't diagnosed the exact cause of this, but there are a series of related
open Python bugs that basically fob the problem off on the backing store,
Berkeley DB.

This module uses SQLite as its backing store. SQLite has quite bold claims of
resilience and robustness, and hammering one of these in the same pattern does
not produce the corruption observed with shelve. Note that high write
contention on one of these may still cause failures (with a "database locked"
error), but your database integrity is preserved at least.

    Return data representing a blank database as a bytearray.

    The motivation for this function.
    One of the surprising things when profiling the original implementation of
    this cache was that a hot spot was creating SQLite databases. The SQLite
    CREATE operation is not particularly efficient, because it is assumed that
    you will not be executing it often. However, we are. This memoized function
    minimises the cost of repeated database creation, cutting build time to 20%
    in a representative project.
