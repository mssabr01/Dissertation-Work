# Python CapDL module

A Python module for providing CapDL support. This is currently a work in
progress and some functionality may not be there or may not work correctly. If
you find an issue let me know and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.

Note: to use the ELF file functionality you will need pyelftools installed. If
you don't have this and don't need this functionality just don't import
anything that imports ELF.py.

* tests/ &mdash; Some basic tests of the functionality
